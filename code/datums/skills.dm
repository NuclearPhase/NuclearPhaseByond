	desc_unskilled = "You can throw a punch or a kick, but it'll knock you off-balance. You're inexperienced and have probably never been in a serious hand-to-hand fight. In a fight, you might panic and run, grab whatever's nearby and blindly strike out with it, or (if the other guy is just as much of a beginner as you are) make a fool out of yourself."
	desc_amateur = "You either have some experience with fistfights, or you have some training in a martial art. You can handle yourself if you really have to, and if you're a security officer, can handle a stun baton at least well enough to get the handcuffs onto a criminal."

You're likely to shoot yourself in the foot or forget to take the safety off. Your lack of training may make you more dangerous to your allies than your enemies."
	desc_amateur = "You know how to handle weapons safely, and you're comfortable using simple weapons. Your aim is decent and you can be trusted not to do anything stupid with a weapon, but your training isn't automatic yet and your performance will degrade in high-stress situations."
	desc_trained = "You've used firearms and other ranged weapons in a high-stress situation, and your skills have become automatic. You spend time practicing at the firing range. Your aim is good. You can maintain and repair your weaponry. You may have military or police experience and you probably carry a weapon on the job."
	desc_professional = "You are an exceptional shot with a variety of weapons, from simple to exotic. You can depend on hitting not just your target, but a specific part of your target, such as shooting someone in the leg. You use a weapon as naturally as though it were a part of your own body. You may be a professional marksman of some kind. You probably know a good deal about tactics, and you may have designed or modified your own weaponry."

If you were to try to set up the engine, you would need someone to talk you through every detail--and even then, you'd probably make deadly mistakes."
